# STraTUS (Software for Transmission Tree Uniform Sampling)
This utility takes as input a phylogenetic tree and, interpreting it as a pathogen phylogeny, uses it to sample uniformly from the set of compatible transmission trees. The procedure is described [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/04/160812).

It is primarily intended for those interested in exploring the structure of transmission tree space, or in developing algorithms to do this.

The code is provided as an R package. Documentation is [here](https://github.com/mdhall272/STraTUS/blob/master/STraTUS/STraTUS.pdf).
